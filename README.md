# bestWebApp

This is a collaborative Java+React project.
We are creating an interactive flashcards application, with an open and exploratory approach, without predefined goals.

## Getting started

To launch backend server, start **src\main\java\com\example\bestwebapp\BestWebAppApplication.java**
To launch frontend, go to **src\frontend** and use ```npm start``` command.

Please mind that backend and frontend are not yet connected (they are working on mock data at this point).
