# bestWebApp

This is a collaborative Java+React project.
We are creating an interactive flashcards application, with an open and exploratory approach, without predefined goals.

## Getting started

- To launch server, start **src\main\java\com\example\bestwebapp\BestWebAppApplication.java**

- To launch frontend (without backend), go to **src\frontend**, run `npm install` and then `npm start` command.

- To make changes to the frontend and integrate it with backend, go to **src\frontend**, run `npm run build` and copy the contents of build folder into **src\main\resources\static**
